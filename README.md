# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Layout Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's flexbox utilities for layout.  Specifically, it focuses on the problem of fractional widths (`w-1/2`, `w-1/3`, etc.) not always resulting in perfect space division, especially when responsive design is involved.

The `bug.html` file shows the problem, while `bugSolution.html` offers a solution.

## Problem
Two `div` elements, each with `w-1/2`, are placed within a flex container. While one would expect them to divide the container's width equally, unexpected gaps or overlapping may occur due to rounding or other factors. This is more pronounced on screens with varying resolutions and when combining fractional widths with other layout properties.

## Solution
The provided solution addresses the issue by using a combination of techniques.  This may include the application of other Tailwind utility classes or a different approach to achieving the desired layout entirely.
